MHDPython
=========

Following the *12 steps to Navier-Stokes*, MHD-Python presents a sequence of Jupyter notebooks towards **MHD**.

It is presented in different parts or *chapters*. When possible, both a *Finite Difference (FD)* and *Finite Element (FE)* will be provided, in this case the *Jupyter* filename will have a suffix *_fd* or *_fe*. 

For the *Finite Element* notebooks, we will use the **Isogeometric Analysis** approach.
